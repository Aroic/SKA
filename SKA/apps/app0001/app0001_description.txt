app0001: 
  Demo program that demonstrates how to animate a character based on
  an ASF/AMC file pair.
  It also illustrated various useful things that aren't
  directly related to the character animation.
  (1) additional objects, such as ground, sky and coordinate axes
  (2) moveable camera, controlled by the camera and mouse.
  (3) keyboard filtering, to avoid multiple responses when
      a single keystroke is expected.
  (4) animation speed control (freeze, single step, time warp)
  (5) heads-up display (2D text on screen)
